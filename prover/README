CS 470 - Theorem Prover Programming Assignment

Here are the steps necessary to complete the program: 

1. Go over the code (prover.c) to make sure you understand how it stores the sentences and predicates. 
We have commented it to help you understand what everything is for.
2. Write the 'Resolve' function to implement your resolution strategy (set of support is a popular
strategy). This will certainly involve writing other various supporting functions to unify sentences,
perform substitutions, etc. 
 
If you find that the source code we provide is too difficult to follow you may want to start from
scratch with your own representation and so forth.
